Taskhopper setup
----------------

When setting up the database, if you choose to not use the Ruby scripts
(<var>load\_data.xq</var> and <var>load\_xquery.rb</var>), be sure to remember
that files stored in this Git repository as <var>.rdf</var> need to be uploaded
to eXist without file extensions.
